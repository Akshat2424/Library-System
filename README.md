# Library-System
This is simply a library that can display all its books if you want.
Here you can lend,add and return books.
The book you lend will be informed to others if he/she wants to lend same book.
Once you return the book then it will be lent by others.
Here the concept is from Object Oriented Programming System(OOPS) with the syntax in Python.
I recently completed OOPS therefore I applied this concept to create this Library System.
